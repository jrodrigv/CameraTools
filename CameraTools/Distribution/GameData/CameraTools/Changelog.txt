v1.16.4
 - Recompiled with KSP 1.12 assemblies.

v1.16.3
Bugfixes:
 - Fix potential NRE when enabling IVA mode.
 - Abort trying to enter IVA mode if it throws an exception.
 - Don't add atmospheric controllers to objects that already have one.

v1.16.2
Bugfixes:
 - Respect random mode when manually activating the camera.
 - Exit IVA mode more reliably to avoid broken flickering camera.
 - Performance optimisations to avoid GC allocations.

v1.16.1
Bugfixes:
 - Fix NRE when vessel is destroyed before switching to IVA mode.
 - Don't immediately re-enter IVA mode if manually switched out of it.

v1.16.0
Bugfixes:
 - Try to reacquire a dogfight target if reverted due to a null dogfight target and Auto-Enable for BDArmory is enabled.
 - Limit the type of vessels atmospheric audio gets added to to avoid saturating KSP's SoundManager channels unnecessarily.
 - Fix indexing bug in 'pathing mode' (note: the example path is still weird).
Improvements:
 - Add sliders for configuring chances of 'random mode'.
 - Add IVA view to 'random mode' (if the vessel has a cockpit, otherwise it counts as dogfight mode).
 - In 'random mode', use the stationary camera when switching to views of a target that is close to the ground or about to crash.
 - Improve the positioning of the stationary camera when switching to views of a target that is close to the ground or about to crash.
 - Recover better from something else stealing the camera parent.

v1.15.4
Bugfixes:
 - Exclude music volume levels from volumes based on distance from the camera.
Improvements:
 - Migrate non-static config files to PluginData to avoid invalidating the ModuleManager cache (should give slightly faster start-up times).

v1.15.3
Bugfixes:
 - Disable slider discretisation when keypad control is enabled.
 - Properly correct for time-warp under almost all conditions for dogfight mode. (It only gets the offset wrong between 70km and 100km above Kerbin and similarly on other bodies.)
 - Eliminate pretty much all graphical glitches caused by floating origin and Krakensbane velocity shifts in dogfight mode.
Improvements:
 - Change the keypad move/zoom speeds to sliders for easier access.
 - Add option to turn on lots of debugging.

v1.15.2
Bugfixes:
 - Don't touch the camera when we're not in control of it!
 - Use TimeWarp times instead of Time times for velocity calculations.
Improvements:
 - Allow switching into and out of IVA and Map modes.

v1.15.1
Bugfixes:
 - Fix missing config file load/save bug.
 - Update all version numbers properly.

v1.15.0
- A bunch of bugfixes.
- Save settings properly.
- Death camera: when in dogfight mode, temporarily follow the explosion when the followed plane gets destroyed.
- Adjustable lerp (interpolation) rate for dogfight mode.
- Adjustable roll amount (based on the followed craft) for dogfight mode.
- Smoother transitions into dogfight mode.
- Auto-enable for BDArmory.
